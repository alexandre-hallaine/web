# Hey

I'm a **developer at CGI Montreal** and a **student at 42 Paris**.

I've been working with **C** for over 5 years and continue using it professionally.  
In my free time, I build websites with **Nuxt** and **Tailwind**, and write low-level code in **Rust**.
Lately, I've also started exploring **Go**.

I'm active on [**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/hallaine.com), and you can find me on [**LinkedIn**](https://linkedin.com/in/alexandre-hallaine) and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/alexandre-hallaine).
