# Hi

I'm **Alexandre Hallaine**, a developer specializing in **C/C++** with solid experience in **TypeScript** and **Kubernetes**. Currently, I work at **CGI in Montreal**, contributing to projects for **Hydro-Qu√©bec**, while completing my studies at **42 Paris**. In my free time, I explore the **Vue.js ecosystem** and continuously expand my technical skills.

My goals for **2025**? Build a **strong foundation in front-end development**, actively contribute to **open source**, and master **Rust** by the third quarter. Outside of coding, I enjoy **cooking**, exploring **Montreal**, and diving into the world of **video games**, sharing these moments with my partner.

Check out my projects and experiments on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/alexandre-hallaine), and feel free to connect with me on [**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/hallaine.com), [**LinkedIn**](https://linkedin.com/in/alexandre-hallaine), or reach out via email at [**alexandre@hallaine.com**](mailto:alexandre@hallaine.com).
