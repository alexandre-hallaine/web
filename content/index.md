# Hi

I’m a **C developer** in **Montreal**, finishing my studies at **42 Paris** and interning at **CGI**.

Lately, I’ve been exploring **web development** with **Vue.js**.

Find my projects on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/alexandre-hallaine), connect on [**LinkedIn**](https://linkedin.com/in/alexandre-hallaine), or email me at [**alexandre@hallaine.com**](mailto:alexandre@hallaine.com). I usually reply fastest by email.
